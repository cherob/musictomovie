# Music to Movie (MTM)

A tool that generates a movie video from an audio track for music video creation. Each track will be represented by emotions, and a story will be created to represent these emotions. This tool may use multiple neural networks.

## Description

The tool works by first categorizing the audio tracks into different emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, love, etc. This helps in creating a story that reflects the same emotion in the video.

A deep learning model is then created that takes in the audio track and generates a story that represents the emotions in the track. This involves using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to analyze the audio and generate a story.

The video is then created by combining the audio track and the story generated, using computer graphics and animation techniques. The model is trained with multiple audio tracks, and its performance is evaluated. The model is fine-tuned to improve its accuracy and efficiency.
